# First CLONE setup

   Make sure you have postgresql and pgadmin installed to interact with the database, lastest version work
   <https://wwww.postgresql.org/download>
   <https://www.pgadmin.org/download/>

   Open pgAdmin make sure you have a server running, add new server with default configuration. Remember credentials
   DEFAULT username = postgres

   git clone https://github.com/assimovt/badigeeks-api.git

   bundle install

   cp .env .env.local

   Modify .env.local with your local database credentials, .env is just for production

   rails db:create

## Setup and configure Heroku

Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) on your development machine. Once installed, the heroku command is available from your terminal.

Log in using your Heroku accountâ€™s email address and password:

```bash
heroku login
```

As collaborator you should be in your master branch to add the heroku remote with this:

```bash
heroku git:remote desolate-cove-97654
```

Verify that the remote was added to your project by running:

```bash
$ git config --list | grep heroku
     remote.heroku.url=https://git.heroku.com/secret-tor-42278.gitremote.heroku.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/heroku/*
```

**Always verify that master is a working branch before deploying.**

Deploy your code with:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

If you are using the database in your application, you need to manually migrate the database by running:

```bash
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

We can now visit the app in our browser with:

```bash
heroku open
```

You can also get the full stream of logs by running the logs command with the --tail flag option like this:$

```shell
heroku logs --tail
```

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.5 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher

Or Docker Compose with the same requirements.

## Recommended git workflow
You can work with only one special branch: `master`. Then, to add new features you can just use meaningful names to create a new branch that will be merged through a PR to `master`. Find more details about this git workflow [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Architecture
The architecture that we follow at the moment @ badi is heavily based on **service objects**. You can find tons of articles about this, but [this one](https://medium.com/selleo/essential-rubyonrails-patterns-part-1-service-objects-1af9f9573ca1) is quite simple and uses the same naming and conventions that we follow.

Also, keep in mind that we use **Grape over Rails**, which means that **we don't use Rails controllers**. Find everything related to endpoints in `app/api/badi/`.

## Testing
We don't mind if we prefer to use TDD or test it after developing the code. However, we expect to have a good code coverage, as close as you can to 100%, but also tests that are significant and stable.

To check your test suite you can simply run `bundle exec rspec`, and after the execution, you can open the coverage report `open coverage/index.html`.

## Guidelines
We encourage you to use [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) and keep the code clean of offenses. Of course, you might find some rules that you don't like it, feel free to customize those if the team agreed.


## Deploy on Heroku
1 .- Download heroku client:
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install
2.- Login with the command  "$ heroku login" and use our badi account
  E-mail: BadiGeeksHubBackend@gmail.com
  Password: W0rk1ngfr0mb4d1
3.- Add Heroku remote:
  $ heroku git:remote -a geekshubbadi
4.- Push the app to the  remote heroku by using:
  $ git push heroku master
5.- Deployed!


## Models structure and associations
The current approach for the model structure can be found in the image below. It includes the defined models with its fields and associations among them.

![models list](public/badi_project_models.png).

If any changes are made to the models, the diagram can be edited by navigating to https://www.draw.io/ and importing the badi_project_models.xml file which can be found in the public project folder.

## Fill the database

In order to fill the database, you will have to execute the following command:
   rake web_sc_namespace:web_scrapping
